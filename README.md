## Project Overview

OpenStreetMaps is designed to offer users an interactive map experience similar to popular mapping services. It consists of several core functionalities:

### Part I: Map Rastering

- **Description**: Given user-specified coordinates of a viewing rectangle and a window size, this part generates a seamless image of the requested map area.
- **Implementation**: The `RasterAPIHandler` class contains the `processRequest` method responsible for processing user requests and returning the appropriate map image.

### Part II: Routing

- **Description**: Routing functionality allows users to obtain step-by-step street directions between two specified locations.
- **Implementation**: Map rastering involves generating a map image based on user queries. The primary goal is to select and arrange a grid of map tiles that closely matches the user's specified criteria.

## Key Components and Algorithms

### LonDPP (Longitude Distance per Pixel)

- **LonDPP**: LonDPP represents the longitudinal distance per pixel, a crucial factor in map rastering.
- The initial LonDPP for depth 0 (depth0DPP) is calculated based on the provided constants from the MapServer class.

### Dynamic Depth Calculation

- The **depth** of the nodes for the rastered image is calculated dynamically based on the user's requested LonDPP.
- The findDepth method ensures that the depth does not exceed the maximum depth of 7, maintaining a balance between detail and efficiency.

### Coordinate Conversion

- Several private methods are used to convert between longitude/latitude and tile positions (`lonToXpos`, `latToYpos`) and vice versa (`xPosToLeftLon`, `xPosToRightLon`, `yPosToLeftLat`, `yPosToRightLat`).
- These methods enable precise positioning of tiles within the grid and accurate bounding box calculations.

### Raster Grid Generation

- The `fillRasterGrid` method plays a crucial role in generating the **raster grid** of image file names (`render_grid`) based on calculated tile positions and depth.
- It efficiently arranges the tiles to reconstruct the complete map image, ensuring seamless rendering.

### Query Success Check

- The `isQuerySuccessful` method is responsible for verifying whether the user's query falls within the bounds of the available map data.
- It accounts for scenarios where the query box extends beyond the boundaries of the map data.


### Part III: Autocomplete

- **Description**: Users can search for locations by entering partial strings, receiving suggestions for matching locations.
- **Implementation**: The autocomplete feature is supported through dedicated Java classes that handle query matching and suggestion generation.

### Part IV: Written Directions

- **Description**: Enhancing the routing feature, OpenStreetMaps provides written driving directions to guide users from their starting point to their destination.
- **Implementation**: Additional logic and classes are employed to transform routing data into easy-to-follow written directions.

## Features

- **Customizable Map Viewing**: Users can specify the map's viewing area and resolution to obtain images tailored to their needs.
- **Efficient Routing**: OpenStreetMaps provides fast and accurate routing information, including distances and turns.
- **Location Suggestions**: Autocomplete functionality aids users in finding specific locations.
- **Clear Directions**: Written directions are presented in a user-friendly format, making navigation straightforward.
- **Interactive Interface**: The web-based interface allows users to interact with the map and access various features seamlessly.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into different Java classes, each responsible for a specific aspect of the application. Here are some essential classes:

- **RasterAPIHandler**: This class handles map rastering requests and returns map images.
- **Routing Classes**: Various classes handle routing, including computing paths and directions.
- **Autocomplete Classes**: These classes assist in location search and suggestion.
- **Written Directions Classes**: Responsible for transforming routing data into written directions.
